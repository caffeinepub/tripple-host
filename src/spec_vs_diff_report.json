  "summary": "REQ-38 and REQ-40 appear implemented on the frontend via centralized nav config (including a Reviews link) and conditional header entry points based on admin existence/admin status. Admin allowlist management UI and React Query hooks were added/updated, but backend-side admin list endpoints/error handling (admin-only enforcement and last-admin removal prevention) are not evidenced in the provided backend diff snippet. Diff also introduces a migration file and mentions a new/repositioned Reviews section, which were not requested and may violate stated non-goals/constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-39",
      "requirement": "Backend enforces admin-only access for viewing/modifying the admin list and returns clear English error messages for unauthorized access; backend prevents removing the last remaining admin with a clear English error message.",
      "reason": "Frontend hooks/components reference getAdminList/add/remove and mention backend enforcement, but the truncated backend diff provided does not show implementations of getAdminList/addAdmin/removeAdmin (or equivalent), nor any explicit checks/error messages for unauthorized access or preventing removal of the last admin.",

The diff summary text indicates the Reviews section is newly added/positioned between Pricing and FAQ, which goes beyond merely adding navigation discoverability.",
