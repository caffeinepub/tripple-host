  "summary": "Diff includes partial updates to deployment docs and significant changes across many frontend application components. The deployment scripts appear to add directory checks and some verification steps, but key acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed due to truncation and the deployment doc still appears incomplete. Many unrelated frontend feature/UI changes were introduced that are outside the deployment-focused BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Fix and complete the deployment documentation in frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md so it is end-to-end for IC mainnet, not abrupt, valid Markdown, references scripts, states working directory, and includes env setup matching .env.example (DFX_NETWORK=ic, II_URL=https://identity.ic0.app).",
      "reason": "The DEPLOYMENT.md content shown is incomplete and appears to end mid-section (\"For local development with `dfx start`:\") with no ordered mainnet deployment section visible in the provided excerpt, and the Markdown shows an opening code fence without a visible closure in the excerpt.",
